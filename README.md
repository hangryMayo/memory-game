## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).


## Objective

The objective of the game is to match all 16 cards (8 pairs). Only two cards can be selected at a time. If it is a match, it will turn green and stay open. If the cards do not match, it will flip back but the same card remains underneath unless the user resets the game or the page refreshes.

## Dependencies

The following is a list of dependencies used to help make this app possible:

* [Font Awesome](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/fontawesome/) â€“ Used to provide icons for all cards.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - The font "Coda" was implemented.

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
